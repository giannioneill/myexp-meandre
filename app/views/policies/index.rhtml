<h3>What are Policies?</h3>

<p>
  myExperiment uses "Policies and Permissions" to provide an Access Control List (what is an <%= link_to 'ACL', "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list" %>?) which can be easily created, managed and attached to as many contributions as you like.
</p>

<p>
  Each Policy contains permissions for viewing, downloading and editing your contributions for both the <b>public</b> (anonymous) and <b>protected</b> (friends or network members) roles.
</p>

<p>
  You can quickly attach Permissions for <b>individual users</b> or <b>whole networks</b> which override the Policy (for example, to give editing access to your team).
